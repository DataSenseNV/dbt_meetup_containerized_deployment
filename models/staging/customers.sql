{# 
    This model references a table that is managed by a seed 
    However, the project might not compile if the seed has not run yet
    To avoid this, we can:
    - Check if the table exists, using the source_exists macro
    - If it exists, write the transformation the intented way
    - If it doesnâ€™t, create a dummy, empty table instead with the exact same column names.
